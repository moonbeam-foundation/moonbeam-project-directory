## Introduction

I Bet You as a decentrilized personal betting protocol that enables users to create simple wagers and earn incentives through participation, going deeper into the DeFi ecosystem. We aim to become a pemissionless blockchain protocol that allows you to bet any amount of tokens with anyone on anything.

The personal bets are usually a long term thing (1-6 months), the locked cryptocurrencies are expected to be generating Yield via lending  or additional "saving" strategies, flash loans etc.  We are sure that the IBY app will be a first step in bringing many users into Defi and hopefully Moonbeam ecosystem (depositing and borrowing) as soon as they understand that the yield from the locked funds is a crypto saving strategy. We hope to bring a lot of users to the ecosystem really fast via onboarding to IBY.

We believe that one of the primary usages for I Bet you will be engaging communities in a meaningful way. Currently, you engage your community with meme competitions, ambassadorship programs and similar mechanics to reward desired behavior. IBY gives a much more meaningful arsenal to anyone in crypto managing a community. Every time there is an argument, claim, plan, or statement, I BET YOU can help settle that quickly. If you don't agree with what you said and think I'm wrong, you can stake something valuable to prove how sure are you in your words. We believe this will create an entirely different power dynamic on discord, telegram channels and even Twitter. We hope this can also help combat the FUD, psyops and all other manipulation techniques.

The application is live right now (https://ibetyou.xyz) its working on MATIC (polygon) and AAVE (we received 2 small grants from both Matic and AAVE) to push the first version.

## Moonbase Alpha Implementation

I Bet You has deployed its dapp to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet, which you can access via [this link](https://ibetyou.xyz/). In this interface you can do the following:

 - Make a personalized bet
 - Challenge someone to prove them that you are right
 - Ensure you have a proof that you WON

### Getting Started with the Interface

First, make sure you have MetaMask set up so that it connects to the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. To do so, you can follow [this guide](/integrations/wallets/metamask/). You can also get DEV tokens from their faucet by following [this tutorial](/getting-started/testnet/faucet/).

With MetaMask properly configured, open the exchange platform using [this link](https://ibetyou.xyz/). In there, click on the "Connect wallet" button, and choose MetaMask.

MetaMask might display a pop-up menu requesting permission to connect the exchange with the wallet. Select the accounts you want to connect to the exchange and click "Next" and then "Connect." 

If everything was set up correctly, you should have the exchange interface connected to "IBetYou". In addition, your current account (in MetaMask) should be displayed in the top right corner, as well as its balance.

Once connected, you can start playing and challenge someone by making your first bet!
