## Introduction to State of the DApps

[State of the DApps](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/){target=_blank} was started in 2016 by Joris Bontje to provide a convenient listing of all of the smart contracts or decentralized applications deployed to Ethereum. It has grown tremendously since then, supporting multiple chains and showcasing a wealth of information. In their own words, *“Whether you are looking for new users, testers, concept feedback, partners, or investors, submitting a DApp to this definitive registry will help your project gain traction.”*

State of the DApps maintains a rank of projects based on active users, transaction volume, developer activity, and profile strength. Moonriver is live on State of the DApps and at the time of writing, both the 2nd and 7th top ranked projects across all ecosystems were built on Moonriver. Previously, a crowd-sourced DApps Listing was maintained [here](/learn/dapps-list/) as part of the Moonbeam docs site. That registry is deprecated and replaced by State of the DApps.

You can [submit your project](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/submit/new){target=_blank} to State of the DApps by providing background on your project including a description of the DApp, screenshots, social media links, and a project status (such as Live, Beta, Prototype, etc). DApps are welcome at any stage in the product life cycle, including ones in the ideation phase. Only a subset of the fields are required, but you are encouraged to complete as many as possible, as providing a more thorough profile for your DApp will improve its ranking.
