## State of the DApps
Previously, a crowd-sourced DApps listing was maintained here as part of the Moonbeam docs site. That registry is deprecated and replaced by [State of the DApps](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/). To list your project / DApp, check out this guide on the [Moonbeam Docs Site](https://docs.moonbeam.network/learn/dapps-list/list-your-project/) that will walk you through the process of submitting your project/DApp to [State of the DApps](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/submit/new).

**Disclaimer:** State of the DApps contains user-generated content. You should verify any information with your own research. Moonbeam is a permissionless network. Any project can deploy its contracts to Moonbeam. 

## Support
Submissions are typically reviewed by the State of the DApps team in one business day. For any Moonbeam-related questions you can reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/moonbeam). For State of the DApps support, you can contact [support@stateofthedapps.com](mailto:support@stateofthedapps.com)
