##State of the DApps
Previously, a crowd-sourced DApps Listing was maintained here as part of the Moonbeam docs site. That registry is deprecated and replaced by State of the DApps. To List your Project / DApp, check out this guide on the [Moonbeam Docs Site](https://docs.moonbeam.network/learn/dapps-list/list-your-project/) or head to [State of the DApps](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/)

**Disclaimer:** The content in this section is entirely managed by the projects themselves. Moonbeam is a permissionless network. Any project can deploy its contracts to Moonbeam. 

## Support
Submission are typically reviewed by the State of the DApps team in one business day. For any Moonbeam-related questions you can reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/moonbeam){target=_blank}. For State of the DApps support, you can contact [support@stateofthedapps.com](mailto:support@stateofthedapps.com)
